# hotelbookingcancellation

Over the years, the hotel industry has changed with a majority of bookings now made through third parties. 

Those Online Travel Agencies (OTA) have transformed cancellation policies from a footnote at the bottom of the page to the main selling point in their marketing campaigns (source). As a result, customers have become accustomed to free cancellation policies. This increase in booking cancellation makes it harder for hotels to accurately forecast, leading to non-optimized occupancy and revenue loss. 

The objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled with the highest accuracy possible and to gain insights about the customers (and hopefully reasons why they cancel their reservation).
